# rcj-sim Planning Repository
This repository is for planning of
[`rcj-sim`](https://github.com/rcj-sim/rcj-sim), the simulation for the
RoboCup Junior league.

## Purpose of rcj-sim
When we partcipated in the RoboCup, it would have been useful to have a
program `rcj-sim`, with which we would have been able to simulate the
behaviour of our robot without having to use real hardware.
Four years later, I started this project to implement exactily this
simulation, mostly for fun.
